# Kaitlin Sullivan
👋 Hi, I’m @kaitsull! I am a neuroscience PhD candidate in the [Cembrowski Lab](https://www.cembrowskilab.com/) at the University of British Columbia.    


### Interests
:microscope:   My PhD work investigates the neural mechanisms underlying fear memory.    
:art: I am also highly interested in exploring the intersection of art and science through digital mediums.     


### My Repos
**mFISH Analysis**  
- [Fiji (ImageJ) Menu Item for mFISH]() registration, segmentation, quantification
- [R Package for mFISH](https://github.com/kaitsull/RUHi), including Shiny App for easy clustering and dimensionality reduction

**scRNA-seq Tools**
- [Automated web search for antibodies]() based on scRNA-seq marker genes (currently for human brain tissue)  


### Currently Learning & Creating...
🌱  Deep learning in Python (for scientific and artistic venues)  
🌱  R Package for mFISH Analysis  
🌱  Shiny App for mFISH Analysis  

### Collaborate
 💞️  Always open to collaborating on 
 💞️  I’m also looking to collaborate on projects that are looking to traverse the science-art rift
