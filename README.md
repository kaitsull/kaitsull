# Kaitlin Sullivan
👋 Hi, I’m @kaitsull! I completed my PhD in Neuroscience in the [Cembrowski Lab](https://www.cembrowskilab.com/) at the University of British Columbia. I am super excited to be starting my Postdoc in the [Pena Lab](https://penalab.org/people) at Princeton University in the near future!    


### Interests
:microscope:   How stress alters the nervous system at the cellular and molecular levels.      
:art: I am also highly interested in exploring the intersection of art and science through digital mediums.     


### My Repos
**mFISH Analysis**  
- [Fiji (ImageJ) Menu Item for mFISH](https://github.com/kaitsull/FijiFISH) registration, segmentation, quantification
- [R Package for mFISH](https://github.com/kaitsull/RUHi), including Shiny App for easy clustering and dimensionality reduction

**scRNA-seq Tools**
- [Automated web search for antibodies](https://github.com/kaitsull/proteinsearch) based on scRNA-seq marker genes (currently for human brain tissue)  


### Currently Learning & Creating...
🌱  Deep learning in Python (for scientific and artistic venues)  
🌱  R Package for mFISH Analysis  
🌱  Shiny App for mFISH Analysis  

### Collaborate
 💞️  Always open to collaborating on work automating and quantifying histology, as well as the analysis of transcriptomic data.    
 💞️  I’m also looking to collaborate on projects that are looking to traverse the science-art rift
